This gem contains the default call router for [Twilreapi.](https://github.com/dwilkie/twilreapi) You can create you own call router gem and inherit from this call router to implement your own custom routing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'twilreapi-active_biller', :github => "dwilkie/twilreapi-active_call_router"
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Checkout the [source](https://github.com/dwilkie/twilreapi-active_call_router/blob/master/lib/twilreapi/active_call_router/base.rb). `Twilreapi::ActiveCallRouter::Base` initializes with a hash of options. The method `#routing_instructions` returns a hash containing your custom routing instructions and will be sent to [Somleng](https://github.com/dwilkie/somleng). By default it just simply returns the passed in options.

## Development
